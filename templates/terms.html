                <p>6.1 Users are held personally liable for any violation of a third party's rights. Users agree to
                    reimburse SpinVantage Limited for all damages resulting from the culpable non-observance of the
                    obligations of these terms and conditions. Users release SpinVantage Limited from all eligible
                    claims that other users or third parties may file against SpinVantageLimiteddue to a violation of
                    their rights by content posted by the user or due to a violation of other obligations. Users shall
                    assume the costs of SpinVantage Limited legal defense, including all court and legal fees. This
                    condition does not apply if the user is not responsible for the infringement.</p>
                <p>6.2 The liability of SpinVantageLimited, on whatever legal grounds, whether due to contractual
                    misconduct or a breach of duty, is ultimately determined in accordance with the following rules:</p>
                <p>6.2.1 If SpinVantage Limited provides the respective liability-causing service free of charge,
                    SpinVantage Limited is liable only for malice and gross negligence.</p>
                <p>6.2.2 In the case of non-gratuitous services, SpinVantage Limited liability is limited to cases of
                    malice and gross negligence, but unlimited in cases of personal injury. In cases of slight
                    negligence, however, SpinVantage Limited will only be liable for a breach of essential contractual
                    obligations such as delay or unavailability which SpinVantage Limited is held responsible for. In
                    the case of a breach of an essential contractual obligation, liability is limited to the typical
                    contractual damages that SpinVantage Limited had to calculate upon conclusion of the contract due to
                    the circumstances prevailing at this time.<br>
                    "Essential contractual obligations", as previously stated, are the obligations that may be relied
                    upon by the user and that ensure that the contract runs in accordance with its regulations and
                    achieves the contractual aim.</p>
                <p>6.2.3 SpinVantageLimited assumes no liability for interruptions within the network that are not the
                    fault of SpinVantage Limited.</p>
                <p>6.2.4 SpinVantageLimited is liable for a loss of data in accordance with the foregoing paragraphs
                    only if such a loss could not have been avoided by adequate backup measures taken by the user.</p>
                <p>6.2.5 The aforementioned liability limitations do not apply in cases of explicit guarantees made by
                    SpinVantageLimited, in cases of malice, and for damages due to the loss of life, limb, or health.
                    Liability shall remain unaffected under the Product Liability Act.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li> a user has sold, bought, or traded a user account, or </li>
                    <li> the user culpably violates laws that serve to protect other players or SpinVantage Limited</li>
                    <li> the user deliberately violates these general terms and conditions, additional governing
                        provisions, and/or the rules of the game.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>7.4 Termination must always be made in writing. Terminations sent via email are considered to have
                    been made in writing.</p>
                <p>7.5 In the case of extended inactivity, SpinVantage Limited is entitled to delete the inactive user
                    account after giving prior notice of this and only after at least 3 months of inactivity. Moreover,
                    SpinVantage Limited is entitled to delete a user account at the end of the contract at its own
                    discretion.</p>
